      Buying your first home is an exciting milestone, but it can also be overwhelming. Between saving for a down payment, finding the right property, and securing a mortgage, there are many moving parts. Here are five crucial things to know before taking the plunge:

      ### 1. Get Pre-Approved Early
      Before you start swiping through real estate apps, know exactly what you can afford. A mortgage pre-approval gives you a clear budget and shows sellers you are a serious buyer.

      ### 2. Don't Forget Closing Costs
      Your down payment isn't the only cash you'll need. Closing costs, including legal fees, land transfer taxes, and home inspections, typically range from 1.5% to 4% of the purchase price.

      ### 3. The Stress Test Matters
      In Canada, you must qualify at a higher interest rate than the one you're actually getting (usually the Bank of Canada qualifying rate or your contract rate plus 2%). This ensures you can still afford payments if rates rise.

      ### 4. Know Your Needs vs. Wants
      Make a list of non-negotiables (like the number of bedrooms or location) versus nice-to-haves (like a pool or finished basement). This will help you stay focused and avoid overspending.

      ### 5. Work with Professionals
      A real estate agent and a mortgage broker are your best advocates. As VIP mortgage experts at MHE Mortgage, we negotiate with dozens of lenders on your behalf to get the lowest rate guaranteed.

      One of the biggest decisions you'll make when getting a mortgage is choosing between a fixed or variable interest rate. With the economic shifts we are seeing in 2026, this decision is more important than ever.

      ### Fixed Rates: The Safe Harbour
      A fixed-rate mortgage means your interest rate and monthly payments stay exactly the same for your entire term (typically 5 years).
      *   **Pros:** Certainty. Peace of mind knowing your payment won't change, making budgeting easy.
      *   **Cons:** If interest rates drop significantly, you're stuck paying the higher premium until renewal. The penalty to break a fixed mortgage can also be quite high.

      ### Variable Rates: Riding the Wave
      A variable rate fluctuates based on the Bank of Canada's prime lending rate.
      *   **Pros:** Historically, variable rates have performed better over time. Penalties to break the mortgage are usually lower (typically just 3 months of interest).
      *   **Cons:** Uncertainty. If the prime rate goes up, your payments (or the portion of your payment going towards interest) will increase.

      ### So, which is better in 2026?
      It ultimately depends on your risk tolerance and financial situation. If you lose sleep over the thought of your payments increasing, fixed is likely the way to go. If you have some wiggle room in your budget and want to take advantage of potential rate drops, a variable rate might be better.

        excerpt: 'Your credit score is the key to unlocking the best mortgage rates. Here’s a step-by-step guide to boosting your score quickly.',

      When lenders look at your mortgage application, your credit score is the first thing they check. A higher score not only increases your chances of approval but gives you access to the lowest "VIP" interest rates. If your score needs a boost, here are fast, effective ways to improve it:

      ### 1. Pay Your Bills on Time, Every Time
      Your payment history makes up the largest chunk of your credit score (roughly 35%). Set up automatic payments for minimum balances to ensure you never miss a due date.

      ### 2. Lower Your Credit Utilization Ratio
      This is the amount of credit you're using compared to your limit. Aim to keep all balances below 30% of their respective limits. If you have a $10,000 credit card limit, try to keep the balance under $3,000.

      ### 3. Don't Close Old Accounts
      The length of your credit history matters. Even if you don't use an old credit card anymore, keep it open (as long as there are no annual fees) to maintain a longer history, which boosts your score.

      ### 4. Check for Errors
      Pull a free copy of your credit report from Equifax or TransUnion Canada. If you see late payments that are incorrect or accounts you didn't open, dispute them immediately. Removing errors can dramatically increase your score.

      ### 5. Limit Hard Inquiries
      Every time you apply for new credit, a "hard inquiry" is recorded, temporarily lowering your score. Only apply for new credit when absolutely necessary, especially in the months leading up to a mortgage application.

      Building credit takes patience, but following these steps can help you see improvements in just a few months.
